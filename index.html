        <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of PK Chishala's life:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1957</strong> - Born in Kitwe, Zambia, Peter Kalumba, better known by his stage name P.K. Chishala, 
             was a Zambian musician. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest artists in the Kalindula genre, 
             playing a key role in its development and popularization. His signature song is "Common Man," and 
             he also produced several other hits, including "Pole-Pole (Church Elder)," "Na Musonda," "Mwaume Walutuku," and more.
            </li>
            <li><strong>1968</strong> - He attended primary school at Mambilima Mission School for the Blind 
             and later pursued his secondary education at Sefula Secondary School in the Western Province. 
             In his early years, P.K. Chishala battled smallpox, which eventually left him blind. 
             Before rising to fame on the Zambian music scene, he worked as a social worker at 
             the Mindolo Ecumenical Foundation (MEF).
            </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1985</strong> - PK Chishala made his debut with "Icisosa Cipamano," which he recorded at
             Malachite Studios during his school days. Although it wasn't a major success, 
             the song hinted at his potential. He followed up with "Ba Pastor," 
             a track that critiqued the immoral behavior of pastors.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1987</strong> - He followed up with the album Church Elder, released under the Kariba label by
             Teal Record Company. The title track exposes the misdeeds of a "church elder" named Pole Pole. 
             The album also features songs like "Impumba Mikowa," a lament from orphans about their struggles, and "Mulele," 
             a Luvale song advising a schoolgirl to focus on completing her education before rushing into marriage.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1988</strong> - PK was chosen as the country’s flag bearer at the 1988 World of 
             Music and Dance (WOMAD) Festival, an annual event held in the UK. 
             This honor came shortly after his track "Mulele" won the 1987 Soloist of the Year Award.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1996</strong> - PK Chishala passed away on June 15, 1996, leaving behind 
            a legacy as a historic Zambian legend. PK is still cherished and adored by many Zambians, 
            with his music remaining as vibrant as if it were produced yesterday. Zambia loves you, PK. 
            May your soul continue to rest in peace.
          </li>
